# Contribute

First of all, we thank you for your interest in our project and any contributions you can make.

## Before you start

`buzzard` is under active development. bugs, enhancements and new features suggestions are warm welcome. See [`TODO`](https://github.com/airware/buzzard/wiki/TODO) for a glimpse to our actual pipeline.

If you have discovered a new bug, please search for existing issues, open and closed, before creating a new one. You can track new ones creating a Github [issue](https://github.com/airware/buzzard/issues). `buzzard` execution environments can be quite complex. Please describe it as much as possible. Reproduction steps and dataset are more than useful!

If you would like to make a significant change, please open a Github [issue](https://github.com/airware/buzzard/issues) first to discuss it.
